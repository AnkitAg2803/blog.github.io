      <p>Environmental health refers to the study of how various external factors in our surroundings can impact human well-being and the overall quality of life. These factors encompass a wide range of elements, such as air and water quality, exposure to hazardous substances, noise pollution, and access to green spaces. The consequences of a compromised environment on human health are profound. Air pollution, for instance, can lead to respiratory illnesses like asthma and even increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Contaminated water sources might result in waterborne diseases, posing serious threats to communities. Noise pollution has been associated with sleep disturbances and stress-related disorders. Moreover, reduced access to natural environments can contribute to mental health issues.</p>
      <br>
      As we strive to understand and mitigate these environmental health impacts, it becomes evident that the well-being of both individuals and societies is intricately linked to the state of our environment. Efforts to combat these effects range from implementing stricter pollution controls and regulations to promoting sustainable practices that reduce the burden on our ecosystems. Ultimately, addressing the relationship between environmental health and human well-being is a crucial step towards creating a healthier and more sustainable future for generations to come.
